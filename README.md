A prototype for an Android app for INEEDASKIP.COM ( https://ineedaskip.com/ )
This app allows users to hire skips to private residences. They can choose the number of skips, what size, and what contents their skip will contain, before being given an automated quote, which they can then confirm.
The users select a drop-off date for the skip, and can choose a pick-up date for the full skip when they order, or at a later date.
The users can also view the orders they have already made.
The app includes a login and database system, achieved using Google Firebase.
